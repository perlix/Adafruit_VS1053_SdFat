  ([perlix]: just a tiny change: use SdFat library instead of SD (long filename support).
  
  I prefer this Adafruit library for my VS1053B projects because it has functions for

  This is a library for the Adafruit VS1053 Codec Breakout

  Designed specifically to work with the Adafruit VS1053 Codec Breakout
